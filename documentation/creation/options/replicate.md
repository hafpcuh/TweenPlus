# Replicate

`Replicate` is one of the many options.

The value controls whether or not the tween will be replicated to the clients (players).\
This option is server-only and requires specific networking [set up](https://app.gitbook.com/s/yQ73a7xL7651w6YiS7XC/networking).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Tween+ does not and is unable to disable Roblox’s replication. Therefore, on top of ensuring `Replicate` is set to `false`, ensure the instance doesn’t exist on any clients, otherwise Roblox will automatically replicate it every frame, leading to a lot of unnecessary network traffic.
{% endhint %}
