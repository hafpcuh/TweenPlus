# Re-use data

Sometimes we can avoid sending certain data, as we may use other data to calculate it locally.

For example, when a player joins mid-tween, we want to inform them of how many repetitions we’ve done already. If reverse is enabled, you might think we should also inform the client of whether or not we’re going in reverse at the moment. But we can actually utilize some simple math in this case:

Since we already have the repetition count, we can use that to calculate the direction we’re moving in. It’s merely a simple check to see if the repetition count is odd or even — if it’s odd, we’re going in reverse, otherwise we’re not.

The reason we can do this is due to the sheer speed of modern processors compared to networks. Running even complex math locally is thousands of times faster than sending a single byte of data over the network.

This simple principle of re-using data can be applied in many other cases as well. Small optimizations like these add up, and can result in significantly reduced network traffic.
